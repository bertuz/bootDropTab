bootDropTab
===========

a jquery plugin that enhances the dropdown tab functionality


Overview
--------
[Tabs](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#tabs) functionality in Bootstrap is awesome, but you could soon find the need of tweaking the Dropdown tab behavior. In fact, each time you click a dropdown tab, the submenu appears. There's no chance to avoid opening the dropdown menu and selecting the desired tab with just one click. Mh, what a pain in the buns!

The default behavior is like this. One click on the tab item = dropdown menu opened

 Why not letting the user open the dropdown menu only when he/she needs to change the item already chosen before (or selected by default)? Plus, why not showing the item selected directly in the tab description?

Well, this is exactly what this plugin aims to do, with very few changes in the bootstrap code we used for creating tabs and dropdown tabs everyday. This means that you can use this plugin without any worry in old projects as well!
